# ExprEval
This is an expression evaluator, that can only handel integer and three opperators.
This is also one of the biggest baabnq programmes i ever wrote and as such may be very buggy.
When compiling, this program will try to link with libs/math.baabnq.
That library is provided as a separate program.
