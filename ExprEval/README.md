# ExprEval
This is an expression evaluator, that can only handel integer and three opperators.
This is also on of the biggest baabnq programmes i ever wrote and as such may be very buggy.
When compiling, this program will try to link with math.baabnq, a small math library i made.
That library is provided as a separate program.
